    /**
     * Provides utility classes for common functionality and error handling in the Tic-Tac-Toe application.
     * <p>
     * The `utils` package includes helper classes and methods that support core application functionality,
     * such as error logging, user notifications, and file operations. These utilities are designed to
     * be reusable and decoupled from the core application logic.
     * </p>
     *
     * <h2>Key Classes:</h2>
     * <ul>
     *     <li><strong>{@link org.example.tictactoe.utils.ErrorHandler}:</strong>
     *         Centralizes error and warning handling with methods for logging and displaying user-friendly alerts.</li>
     *     <li><strong>{@link org.example.tictactoe.utils.FileUtils}:</strong>
     *         Provides utility methods for reading from and writing to files, handling common file operations.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Provide reusable functionality that can be leveraged across different parts of the application.</li>
     *     <li>Standardize error handling and user notifications.</li>
     *     <li>Simplify file operations, including reading lists and writing data to files.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h2>Design Principles:</h2>
     * <p>
     * The utilities in this package adhere to key software design principles:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle:</strong> Each utility class is responsible for a specific aspect
     *         of functionality, such as file handling or error management.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> The utilities are designed to be easily integrated and reused across
     *         the application.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h2>Error Handling and Logging:</h2>
     * <p>
     * Utilities like {@link org.example.tictactoe.utils.ErrorHandler} provide consistent error logging and handling,
     * ensuring that issues are logged for debugging and, when appropriate, presented to the user via alerts.
     * </p>
     *
     * <h2>Usage:</h2>
     * <p>
     * Utility classes in this package are intended for use throughout the application wherever their functionality
     * is needed, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
     * </p>
