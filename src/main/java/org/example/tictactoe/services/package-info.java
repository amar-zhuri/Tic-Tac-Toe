/**
 * Provides services for data persistence and file management in the Tic-Tac-Toe application.
 * <p>
 * The `services` package includes interfaces and implementations that handle the storage and retrieval
 * of game data, such as game results and leaderboard statistics. These services abstract the file system
 * operations to ensure flexibility and maintainability.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Classes and Interfaces:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>{@link org.example.tictactoe.services.PersistenceService}:</strong>
 *         Defines the contract for saving and loading data in various formats.</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@link org.example.tictactoe.services.FilePersistenceService}:</strong>
 *         Implements the {@link org.example.tictactoe.services.PersistenceService} interface
 *         for saving and loading lists of data to and from files.</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@link org.example.tictactoe.services.StatsPersistenceService}:</strong>
 *         Provides specialized functionality for saving and loading leaderboard statistics.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Abstract data persistence logic to decouple it from the core application logic.</li>
 *     <li>Provide reusable and extensible mechanisms for saving and retrieving game-related data.</li>
 *     <li>Handle error scenarios gracefully and log issues for debugging purposes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Design Principles:</h2>
 * <p>
 * The services adhere to important software design principles:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Interface Segregation:</strong> The {@link org.example.tictactoe.services.PersistenceService}
 *         interface provides a clear contract for data persistence, enabling different implementations.</li>
 *     <li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle:</strong> Each service class focuses on a single aspect of persistence,
 *         such as handling statistics or lists of game results.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Logging and Error Handling:</h2>
 * <p>
 * Logging is integrated throughout the services to provide transparency into data operations, such as reading from
 * or writing to files. Errors are logged with context, and graceful handling ensures that the application remains stable
 * even when file operations fail.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <p>
 * These services are utilized by higher-level classes, such as {@link org.example.tictactoe.models.Leaderboard}
 * and {@link org.example.tictactoe.models.Stats}, to persist game-related data.
 * </p>
